# N76HandyLibs
A few libraries for nuvoton N76E003.
N76E003AT20 are an inexpensive family of 8051 MCUs made by nuvoton, taiwan. they are made to be a drop in replacement for STM8S003F3P6 8 bit microcontrollers which are inexpensive and somehow revolutionary, in a market flooded by poor peripheral, pricey atmel and microchips. (well we didn't know they were pricey until STM made those chips!).

anyway, these nuvotons worth a try too. so here are some useful libraries I wrote for them. to use them, you need to :

1) include a peripheral driver according to the library (e.g. i2c_handler). these libraries are just general purpose drivers for various peripherals. they are not specific to libraries provided. you may use them for other things too. and they are written in a similar syntax to other drivers like those of provided by atmel for its AVRs.
2) include the library in your project.
3) read the header files and the example project to find out what you got and how to use them.
4) done :)
